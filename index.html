                    <p class="info_text">
                        My mission is to give, for giving is what I do best and I can learn to do better.

                        I will seek to learn, for learning is the basis for growth, and growing is the key to living. I will seek first to understand, for understanding is the key to finding value, and value is the basis for respect, decisions, and action. This should be my first act with my wife, my family, and my business.

                        I want to help influence the future development of people and organizations. I want to teach my children and others to love and laugh, to learn and grow beyond their current bounds.

                        I will build personal, business, and civic relationships by giving, in frequent little ways.

                    </div>
                    <p class="info_text">World is the space where we live. Living is not just counting and spending the days when we are medically alive; rather life has a very deep meaning. To live we need to sense, feel and have some sort of excitement to clean up the space we are occupying. Life is more abstract in practical terms. To live, the world needs to maintain an order. Every person has a different vision to set things on the right slot. Every vision is to its level best with respect to the person who is dreaming. Let me come up with my view of the world in a ideal place.</p>
